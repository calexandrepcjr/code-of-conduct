## Introduction

This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by {institution}, including online services as Telegram, IRC, all public and private mailing lists, issue trackers, wikis, blogs, Twitter, and any other communication channel used by our communities.

We expect this code of conduct to be honored by everyone who participates in the {institution} community formally or informally, or claims any affiliation with the community, in any community-related activities.

This code is not complete, feel encouraged to participate. Just remember to maintain the code very concise and broad, our goal is to create a prolific community where everyone can feel good, grow as a person and help others.

## Expected Behavior

### Be responsible
- Each action builds the environment that you want to live
### Be welcoming, kind, emphatetic
- Working together to resolve conflict and do our best to act in an empathetic way
- We may all experience some frustration from time to time, but we do not allow frustration to turn into a personal attack
- A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one
- We should be respectful when dealing with other community members as well as with people outside our community
### Be collaborative
- The community was born by collaboration, people that want to help others by their skills
- Without collaboration spirit, no initiative will prosper. Don't **use** the community, participate and grow together
### Be respectful of other viewpoints and ideas
- Sharing the same space with many people will eventually lead to some conflicts about some concepts
- Perspective is very different of right / wrong, but about how you get there
- Discuss about, but never put others down
### Be supportive and look out for each other
- Remember when you started something? Taking care of each other guides the community to another level,
where everyone can learn and share their knowledge
### Be inquisitive
- Nobody knows everything, asking questions early can avoid problems later
- Questions must be encouraged, only questioning can show room for improvement
### Be concise
- Everyone has another activity besides the community itself
- Writing concise messages can help the understanding and saves time
- Try to maintain inside the discussion topic, especially those large ones
### Help the industry become a better place
- Invite the community inside your workplace
- Share your problems, bring cases
- Invite your coworkers to participate
- When sharing a work offer, put the job's budget: Usually companies avoid sharing them to leverage the
market by the lowest offer. Break this cycle
### Give it back
- When someone helps you, give feedback, so everyone can learn with your experience

## Unacceptable Behavior

Harassment may include but not limited to the following:

- Offensive, inappropriate, or unwanted comments - when someone asks to stop, stop.
- Disrespect towards differences of opinion
- Sustained disruption of talks or other events
- Intimidation or bullying (online or in-person)
- SPAM - the act of sending marketing oriented posts without context or even approval from the admins is considered spamming
- Flood - the act of inundate a source of interaction with messages of your own is considered flooding
- Sharing work offers without budget
